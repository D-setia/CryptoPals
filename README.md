CryptoPals
--

This is my journey into crypto. I have some knowledge about various cryptographic techinques but almost no experience in scripting and thus this project.

I'll be solving the cryptoPals questions available at: https://cryptopals.com/

I will proceed set by set. 
For each question in the set, first I'll write the scripts. I'll prepare a writeup for each one once I'm done with the set.

Since this is a learning exercise, these ~~probably~~ definitely won't be the optimal solutions. I hope by the end of this, reading the initial scripts makes me want to bang my head against a wall because that is the only sign of progress.

Feel free to open issues if you find something wrong :)
